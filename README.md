# COMP2003
Object Oriented Software Engineering (Year 2, Semester 1)

What is usually hailed as the most useful unit in the SE degree at Curtin, this unit teaches more complex OO structures to students to allow them to better structure their classes/programs to meet the at-times complex requirements of software projects. It introduces the concept of polymorphism and how to go about creating highly cohesive but loosely coupled designs, containers and generics for high code reuse, and factories dependency injections for better design testability. There was also a focus on UML and how we can use it to plan out our designs for classes and their interactions before coding.

This repository contains the files for an assignment where I had to model and display the hierarchical nature of a city's power supply, the data of which was either read or generated. Refer to the README.txt in the repository for how to run the program.
